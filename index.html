<h1>The Flooded Kitchen</h1>

<p class="preface">Large kitchen. Everything in ruins. Flooded floors.</p>

<p>Moldy, organic, small creatures hiding in shadows, horrible stench</p>

<p><span class="underline">Prisoners:</span> 3 unlucky adventurers are held in a small cell. They are the dinner. They beg for help and raise hell if the players won't help them.
</p>

<p><span class="underline">Food:</span> There might be food in the kitchen. Players can search for it. It might be rotten.
